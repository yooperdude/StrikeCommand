Wars are no longer being fought in buttfuckistan by major operators but across the globe in many, many regions. Now with a reduced budget, and a desire to keep taxes down, the US has sanctioned a bunch of Private Military Contractors.</p> <p>(That's You BTW)</p> <p>With the defunding of NATO, Congress has decided to make these PMC's earn each buck instead of just pissing it away in procurement. There's a midterm election coming and by god the senator from Kentucky cannot have a tax increase. Similar situations have occured throughout Europe. In a nutshell it's like Ayn Rand wrote the military defense budget.</p> <p>Fortunately there's pockets of stability. Unfortunately most of the rest of the world shit in a bag and lit it on fire.</p> <p>In 2019 China invaded Taiwan, or rather tried to. A fierce missile battle ended with the Taiwanese launching a tactical nuclear warhead into the Chinese invasion staging area. An hour later they launched a second missile that airburst over Guangzhou. The Taiwanese not only had managed to design and manufacture their own subs but also had retrieved some warheads from K-219 near Bermuda.</p> <p>In the ensuing months China broke apart as a nation as the economy collapsed. Today there is everything from rampant capitalists to staunch Maoists. Beijing is trying to bring it all back together but it's a damned mess. In many areas it's unclear who's really in charge.</p> <p>The Taiwanese subs were suspiciously close to a variant of the US Navy. Speculation was that the US assisted the Taiwanese in designing the subs as conventional missile subs and they had no idea of the Taiwanese nuclear capabilities.</p> <p>In this same area North Korea is shitting on South Korea but open hostilities haven't started. Yet.</p> <p>Add fluff image here</p> <p>Russia in the East is a province of its own that as long as it supplies raw materials to Russia in the West, no one asks any questions. Oddly enough the fishing fleets in this area have proven to be the greatest source of friction as everyone is out to harvest those waters.</p> <p>India and Pakistan haven't tossed nukes at each other but Kashmir is still a sticking point. It was an autonomous UN zone for about a week and then the shitstorm hit. For now it's a no mans land that no country dares claim. Tibet is in the midst of a rebirth, though China still has the hammer down.</p> <p>Eastern Europe is simply the unstable zone. Russia, unable to conquer it all militarily, has instead sought to destabilize the zone economicaly, militarily, and culturally. Romania skirmishes with Bulgaria. Ukraine continues to struggle under Russian attack. The Balkan states are just a huge basket of fuck no. Estonia leads up the anti-Russian league but lacks anyone with any muscle to back it up. For now Russia is satisfied to just create the chaos.</p> <p>The Former Yugoslav states have merged into an odd economic zone that purchased all of Greece's debt from Germany. Now they manufacture weapons for sale to damned near everyone else. Greece is poor but mostly stable. Though a good deal of Greek nationalists are foaming at the mouth for independence.</p> <p>More fluff here</p> <p>Turkey still stands but damn near everything near her is a dumpster fire. Iran and the Saudi's came to blows once and both sides were completely embarrassed by the UAE Air Force. The UAE is the only stabilizing force at the moment and if they pull back it'll go to shit.</p> <p>North Africa has settled into a staging point for everyone to get the fuck out and to Europe. Italy is the main collection point to send them all back. We won't get into the rest of the details of Africa right now. But reserves of rare earth metals there have proven to eclipsed even the demand, and cruelty, for mining diamonds.</p> <p>South and Central America is a playground for the CIA and DEA. PMC operations in that area are discouraged unless sanctioned. As of now the lithium deposits in Chile and Bolivia make those countries like Saudi Arabia was in the 1980's.

Nor have they had to worry about any SAM threat in these operations. This has changed perceptions about air operations in a way that will make you very surprised when you finally encounter a peer adversary with SAM coverage.</p> <p>The largest, and most experienced, air force with the greatest media coverage has made our perception of air war incredibly lopsided. If you are in the military you likely understand this and also understand that a great jet does not win the battle but the logistics backbone, intelligence services, maintenance expertise, and sheer bulk of training. The battle is won before that jet ever takes off.</p> <p>Except you don't have all of those advantages. You will lose planes.

This forces the SAM radars to attempt to acquire targets, you then either jam them using OECM or hit that with anti-radiation missiles. If your timing is perfect about now your fighters will engage hostiles fighters, and if you have superior tactics or overwhelming numbers then you might punch a hole.

You will have a wide range of capable aircraft with capable ordnance, but it pre-dates the US-NATO massive expansion of weaponry. A 1989 F-16 is much closer to a MIG-29 then the 2022 models.</p> <p>Given such a wide range you can run into issues where a slight change in model year can have radically different radar performance and significantly longer air to air capabilities.

Be aware that losses happen fast, and sometimes the best thing to do is GTFO. Now this can work to your advantage, knock out a couple of flight of hostile aircraft and suddenly you dominate the skies.</p> <p>The best way to do this is have the awareness advantage. A well situated radar or airborne early warning radar will do more for your situational awareness than anything else. On top of this it allows your aircraft to not emit radar until absolutely neccessary. If done correctly the opposing force won't know you are there until they are defending from air to air missiles.</p> <p>Barring an awareness advantage it comes down to range, evasiveness, and tactics. Shooting first is always excellent, so is being maneuverable, but absent that you can divert hostiles with a feint or lure them into friendly SAM range.
