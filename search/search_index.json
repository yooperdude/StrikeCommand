Your decision as a player will decide failure, or success, of the mission and the profitability of your group. </p> <p>The MC (Mission Commander) is the dungeon master; he or she will lay out the scenarios and drive the campaign forward. This person also runs the simulation side of things. </p> <p>The mission flow starts with building your mercenary group. Picking assets like airplanes, hiring skilled (or cheaper unskilled) pilots, munitions, and support assets. Then you settle on a theater of operations or get hired by your employer. Mission tasking follows with the players planning the mission and deciding how best to use available assets.</p> <p>The MC will build the mission in Command Modern Operations and run it with the players.</p> <p>Following the mission the MC tallies up losses, determines profitability, and the players move ahead with a larger, or smaller, bank account. </p> <p>Your success or failure determines if you slink away from the AO (area of operations) or purchase fancy munitions for a new F-16.</p>"}]}
