Wars are no longer being fought in buttfuckistan by major operators but across the globe in many, many regions. Now with a reduced budget, and a desire to keep taxes down, the US has sanctioned a bunch of Private Military Contractors.</p> <p>(That's You BTW)</p> <p>With the defunding of NATO, Congress has decided to make these PMC's earn each buck instead of just pissing it away in procurement. There's a midterm election coming and by god the senator from Kentucky cannot have a tax increase. Similar situations have occured throughout Europe. In a nutshell it's like Ayn Rand wrote the military defense budget.</p> <p>Fortunately there's pockets of stability. Unfortunately most of the rest of the world shit in a bag and lit it on fire.</p> <p>In 2019 China invaded Taiwan, or rather tried to. A fierce missile battle ended with the Taiwanese launching a tactical nuclear warhead into the Chinese invasion staging area. An hour later they launched a second missile that airburst over Guangzhou. The Taiwanese not only had managed to design and manufacture their own subs but also had retrieved some warheads from K-219 near Bermuda.</p> <p>In the ensuing months China broke apart as a nation as the economy collapsed. Today there is everything from rampant capitalists to staunch Maoists. Beijing is trying to bring it all back together but it's a damned mess. In many areas it's unclear who's really in charge.</p> <p>The Taiwanese subs were suspiciously close to a variant of the US Navy. Speculation was that the US assisted the Taiwanese in designing the subs as conventional missile subs and they had no idea of the Taiwanese nuclear capabilities.</p> <p>In this same area North Korea is shitting on South Korea but open hostilities haven't started. Yet.</p> <p>Add fluff image here</p> <p>Russia in the East is a province of its own that as long as it supplies raw materials to Russia in the West, no one asks any questions. Oddly enough the fishing fleets in this area have proven to be the greatest source of friction as everyone is out to harvest those waters.</p> <p>India and Pakistan haven't tossed nukes at each other but Kashmir is still a sticking point. It was an autonomous UN zone for about a week and then the shitstorm hit. For now it's a no mans land that no country dares claim. Tibet is in the midst of a rebirth, though China still has the hammer down.</p> <p>Eastern Europe is simply the unstable zone. Russia, unable to conquer it all militarily, has instead sought to destabilize the zone economicaly, militarily, and culturally. Romania skirmishes with Bulgaria. Ukraine continues to struggle under Russian attack. The Balkan states are just a huge basket of fuck no. Estonia leads up the anti-Russian league but lacks anyone with any muscle to back it up. For now Russia is satisfied to just create the chaos.</p> <p>The Former Yugoslav states have merged into an odd economic zone that purchased all of Greece's debt from Germany. Now they manufacture weapons for sale to damned near everyone else. Greece is poor but mostly stable. Though a good deal of Greek nationalists are foaming at the mouth for independence.</p> <p>More fluff here</p> <p>Turkey still stands but damn near everything near her is a dumpster fire. Iran and the Saudi's came to blows once and both sides were completely embarrassed by the UAE Air Force. The UAE is the only stabilizing force at the moment and if they pull back it'll go to shit.</p> <p>North Africa has settled into a staging point for everyone to get the fuck out and to Europe. Italy is the main collection point to send them all back. We won't get into the rest of the details of Africa right now. But reserves of rare earth metals there have proven to eclipsed even the demand, and cruelty, for mining diamonds.</p> <p>South and Central America is a playground for the CIA and DEA. PMC operations in that area are discouraged unless sanctioned. As of now the lithium deposits in Chile and Bolivia make those countries like Saudi Arabia was in the 1980's.

Should you lose an airframe it will be replaced. It may not arrive in time for the next mission but you will still end up with a functional airframe. One, the accountants love tax write offs, and two, it's not fun to plan a mission and have the stress of losing every aircraft on your shoulders.</p> <p>The Supplier is critically important and locks you in to a certain group of airframes. For example if you choose to fly Russian aircraft from the Ivanov Brothers then it becomes exceptionally expensive to purchase non-Russian aircraft with Procurement Points. Why?
