# The Absolute Basics

You are the shareholders, executives, and tactical commanders of Strike Command. Your decision as a player will decide failure, or success, of the mission and the profitability of your group. 

The MC (Mission Commander) is the dungeon master; they will lay out the scenarios and drive the campaign forward. This person also runs the simulation and directs the battle space. 

The mission flow starts with building your character, then your mercenary group. Picking assets like airplanes, hiring skilled (or cheaper unskilled) pilots, munitions, and support assets. Then you settle on a theater of operations, get hired by your employer, and pick your missions. Mission tasking follows with the players planning the mission and deciding how best to use available assets.

The MC will build the mission in Command Modern Operations and run it with the players.

Following the mission the MC tallies up losses, determines profitability, and the players move ahead with a larger, or smaller, bank account. 

Your success or failure determines if you slink away from the AO (area of operations) or purchase fancy munitions for a new F-16.

## Your Character

Unlike traditional RPG's, your character is not a super hero but someone like you and me. Your skills and abilities come from your training, experience, and charisma. Most characters in Strike Command will be non-combatants. The challenges you face will not usually be as an individual character but as a collective group.

You do have skills. These can range from passive effects such as reduced maintenance costs, improved reaction times for a unit under your command, to active effects such as cyber attacks or prepared detonation. Your character progresses much as we do, monetarily and with the skills gained from difficult situations.

## Your Corporation

The "Party" is the management of the corporation. Your group will make decisions about how the operation is run, what to acquire, where to send it, and how to perform missions. Even if your group is plucky maintenance techs, you are still shareholders of the group and as such have a special say in operations. 

The corporation will have a certain root that ties it to it's past. This could be a contact with the CIA, a contract with LockMart, or even a cargo airline that flew rubber chickens out of Hong Kong.

The Corporation will have a slew of NPC's that can do special tasks or can be used by the GM to offset events. For example you may hire a Washington Based Lobbyist, a team of Ex-Marines for Base Security, or a Faygo slamming Juggalo. The options are endless and are completely based on your playstyle.

Once you have the bones of your Corporation built you head to Procurement.

## Procurement

Now the fun really begins. You begin procurement with a base level of Procurement Points (PP). You will first choose which origin of aircraft then branch into airframes, tech upgrades, and pilots. Finally if you've saved some PP you can spend it on ground facilities such as Radar's and SAM's.

Assets purchased through Procurement are insured. Should you lose an airframe it will be replaced. It may not arrive in time for the next mission but you will still end up with a functional airframe. One, the accountants love tax write offs, and two, it's not fun to plan a mission and have the stress of losing every aircraft on your shoulders.

The Origin is critically important and locks you in to a certain group of airframes. For example if you choose to fly Russian aircraft then it becomes exceptionally expensive to purchase non-Russian aircraft with Procurement Points. Why? You have maintenance teams, replacement parts, and the institutional knowledge to maintain Russian Aircraft, tossing a South African fighter into the mix is a completely different animal.

Except on the Black Market.

## Black Market

On the Black Market you can spend PP on whatever is available. During this phase the MC will determine which equipment is available. A character may have connections that either increase the quantity available or the quality of what is available. After purchase the asset is available immediately.

So what's the catch? First, no insurance. It's not on the books. And two, there is a maintenance penalty that determines if the aircraft is usable or a pile of junk. Yes, you have a singular YAK-38. It's great for the first mission but every following mission increases its chance of failure by 25%. 

Use it, and then lose it.

## Theater of Operations   

You will determine where in the world you want to go. Certain hot spots will require mercenary intervention. You will need to determine where you are based and spend PP to get the facilities as you want them. Certain aircraft require longer runways or larger hangars. Note, you have 1/4 of your spent PP available for this.

Inside each theater will be factions, corporations, and other mercenary groups. How you interact with them will be up to you. Certain national factions can also be present and have long term impacts on your group. No one cares if you blow up a Pork Magnate's villa, but angering MI6 can cost you down the road. 

## Playing the Game

Once the group is made and the theater decided the MC will offer missions. The players will work off maps, intel drops, and their wits, to plan the mission. The MC will take this information, build it in Command Modern Operations, and then run it live for the players. Once all aircraft have landed you will earn PP's for completing objectives.

Damaged or lost aircraft may, or may not, be available for the next mission. 

The MC will analyze the theater, move the opposing forces, and determine how the theater was impacted. 

## After Action

Upon exiting the theater the players can go through another round of procurement and spend earned points on aircraft upgrades. Personnel such as pilots or crews may also be upgraded to allow for faster reaction times.
