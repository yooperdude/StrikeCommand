# The Absolute Basics

You are the shareholders, executives, and tactical commanders of Strike Command. Your decision as a player will decide failure, or success, of the mission and the profitability of your group. 

The MC (Mission Commander) is the dungeon master; he or she will lay out the scenarios and drive the campaign forward. This person also runs the simulation side of things. 

The mission flow starts with building your mercenary group. Picking assets like airplanes, hiring skilled (or cheaper unskilled) pilots, munitions, and support assets. Then you settle on a theater of operations or get hired by your employer. Mission tasking follows with the players planning the mission and deciding how best to use available assets.

The MC will build the mission in Command Modern Operations and run it with the players.

Following the mission the MC tallies up losses, determines profitability, and the players move ahead with a larger, or smaller, bank account. 

Your success or failure determines if you slink away from the AO (area of operations) or purchase fancy munitions for a new F-16.
