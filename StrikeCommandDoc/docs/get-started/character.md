# Your Character

Who are *you*?

In the world of Strike Command the dissolution of NATO, distrust in institutions, and military downsizing has left plenty of opportunities for the discerning mercenary. Your background, technical skills, and connections are what define you as an individual. 

*Note : We will provide examples and a framework, but it is up to the MC's discretion if you'd like to make a custom character.*

## Name

Your name can define you or damn you. A throughly American name may be bland to one persons ear, but stereotype them to someone else. Meanwhile a thick Russian name can open doors where John Smith may not. Tribal loyalties, no matter how faint, are sometimes all that hold groups together. Think if you met someone named Steve, or Stephan von der Marwitz. The former might get you into Arby's, the latter admission to an exclusive Polish dinner club. Be bold. Be *you*.

## Callsign

Who are you in the *skies*?

!!! Note

    It is customary to choose a callsign even if you are not a pilot. This tradition is known as "dorfing", as is a verb, used like "Dorf me in the SU-22.". You will, for no reason other than the excitement, have a pilot using that callsign on missions. This is not your player but instead a way to emotionally connect with the planes in the air.  

The best callsigns are not chosen, but earned. Dumbo. Jello. Humpy. Slurp. You do <ins>not</ins> want to walk in and proclaim your callsign to be *Maverick*, *Ace* or *Eagle*. You may find yourself walking out with a career defining callsign like "Dipshit". If all else, ask your co-mercenaries for a callsign.

## Background

Who *were* you? 

Did you spend the last 10 years flying Strike Eagles in Operation Bomb Dirt only to be "retired" during a budget crunch? Were you a digital scout for a CIA wet team who was no longer needed and considered a relic of the past? Or maybe you are just a corporate accountant leaving McKinsey for greener paychecks?

Every background will provide a boon of some sort, as well as a hook. You can discuss your background with your MC, but here are some examples to get you started. Certain boons and hooks can be worked into the narrative while others have a concrete benefit such as **Procurement Points :fontawesome-regular-money-bill-1:** or extra black market options.
