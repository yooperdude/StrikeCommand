# Your Character

Who are *you*?

In the world of Strike Command the dissolution of NATO, distrust in institutions, and military downsizing has left plenty of opportunities for the discerning mercenary. Your background, technical skills, and connections are what define you as an individual. 

*Note : We will provide examples and a framework, but it is up to the MC's discretion if you'd like to make a custom character.*

## Name

Your name can define you or damn you. A throughly American name may be bland to one persons ear, but stereotype them to someone else. Meanwhile a thick Russian name can open doors where John Smith may not. Tribal loyalties, no matter how faint, are sometimes all that hold groups together. Think if you met someone named Steve, or Stephan von der Marwitz. The former might get you into Arby's, the latter admission to an exclusive Polish dinner club. Be bold. Be *you*.

## Callsign

Who are you in the *skies*?

!!! Note

    It is customary to choose a callsign even if you are not a pilot. This tradition is known as "dorfing", and is a verb, used like "Dorf me in the SU-22.". You will, for no reason other than the excitement, have a pilot using that callsign on missions. This is not your player but instead a way to emotionally connect with the planes in the air. The dorf'd plane will follow the mission plan and is *not under direct control of the player.* 

The best callsigns are not chosen, but earned. Dumbo. Jello. Humpy. Slurp. You do <ins>not</ins> want to walk in and proclaim your callsign to be *Maverick*, *Ace* or *Eagle*. You may find yourself walking out with a career defining callsign like "Dipshit". If all else, ask your co-mercenaries for a callsign.

## Background

Who *were* you? 

Did you spend the last 10 years flying Strike Eagles in Operation Bomb Dirt only to be "retired" during the budget crunch? Were you a digital scout for a CIA wet team who was no longer needed and considered a relic of the past? Or maybe you are just a corporate accountant leaving McKinsey for greener paychecks?

Every background will provide a boon of some sort. You can discuss your background with your MC, but here are some examples to get you started. Certain boons can be worked into the narrative while others have a concrete benefit such as **Procurement Points :fontawesome-regular-money-bill-1:** or extra black market options.

**CIA Operative**, Once in the Company with connections and skills(1), now out. Mostly.(2)
{ .annotate }

1.  You gain access to intelligence and ground operatives if it fits the needs of the CIA.
2.  You may be drawn into a CIA operation in the theater.

**Flight Maintenance Lead**, A top-notch aircraft maintenance asset. (1) Long tours, long hours, and the need to do things right. (2) 
{.annotate}

1.   Reduce the duration of scheduled maintenance down times by **one day.**
2.   Repair durations shortened. (GM Discretion)


**LockMart Executive**, You are the embodiment of the Military Industrial Complex (1) While you may know it all, the knowing has earned you plenty of enemies. (2) 
{.annotate}

1.   During Procurment you acquire one additional Flight (2 Aircraft) of aircraft for the same PP.
2.   If an NPC can take the opportunity to shaft you, they will. 


**Weapons Dealer**, You've run guns from Libya to North Korea. (1) But those connections have caused some legal friction. (2) 
{.annotate}

1.   Any time you visit the Black Market you may discard one choice and ask the MC to draw another. 
2.   Interpol calling! You may find yourself under "unique" legal pressures.


**Squadron Commander**, You've already had flights of aircraft under your command and are probably the only expert in the group. (1) But you don't know a damn thing about running a mercenary business. (2) 
{.annotate}

1.   Two flights of aircraft gain one level bump in proficiency.
2.   Automatically fail negotiations with another mercenary group.


**NSA Hacker**, You are a 21st century cyber warrior(1) who isn't used to operating outside of the NSA.
{.annotate} 

1. Gain an additional cyber option during each mission.

!!! Note

    Some boons are directly usable in the mission itself. You should communicate with the MC your intent to use a boon that would happen during the mission. Other boons happen outside of the simulation and can be dealt with as the situation arises. 


## Connections

*Who* do you know?

In the course of your career you will know someone who can help you. This might be a mentor, a co-worker, a classmate, or an ex-boss. You also build connections over time. A mercenary group you fly with today might be convinced to be a partner later if you can build that rapport. Connections aren't typically monetary, then they'd be investors. A connection will only do as much as friend would, so it's unlikely they'd single handedly assault a stronghold, but they might pass along some photos of the air defenses.

When you develop your connections think of three people who had an impact on your career. List their name and title, and that's it. The narrative can develop as to what that person may be able to provide. (See the MC)

Any meaningful interaction with an NPC also has an opportunity to create a connection. There are three levels of NPC connections, "acquaintance", "friend" and "ally". It's unlikely your first mission would create an ally, but you'd probably become an acquaintance, maybe after a few missions or situations you'd become a friend. Alternatively if you betrayed someone then you would still be an acquaintance, but unlikely to become friends or allys again. 

## Progression

What have you *done*?

Think of this like your resume. As the game progresses not only will you acquire  **Procurement Points :fontawesome-regular-money-bill-1:** (or not?) but you will gain experience. These may be new connections, technical skills, but will most likely act as lessons for future missions. Few things educate you like watching a flight of jets get wiped out by an SA-6 because you cheaped out on SEAD. 

How do you define the skills you've learned in mission planning into a nice RPG like grid? Instead, these are your lessons earned the hard way and lessons that will transfer to future playthroughs. Anytime a major event happens, list that on your progression. 

## Examples

Your character sheet probably fits onto an index card, maybe even a business card. It might not seem like a lot for your character to work with, but you have a lifetimes worth of experience to pull from. Here are a few examples.

**Marcellus** *"Popeye"* is an ex-Air Force ordnance disposal technician. His specialty is clearing mines(1) and unexploded ordnance(2). His connections include a Para-rescue mentor, a Raytheon training contact, and an Argentine Marine who worked with him in the past.
{.annotate}

1.   Any minefields encountered in the area can be neutralized if not under fire.
2.   He can use his time between missions to deal with UXO and improve the relations with the locals.


**Belle** *"Woobie"* was a CIA Analyst who specialized in NATO Relations. Her specialties are contract deals (1) with ex-NATO countries as well as the legal hurdles that may arise(2). Her connections are a CIA ex-Boss, a Belgian french-fry magnate, and an Italian Merchant Marine Captain.
{.annotate}

1.   She can negotiate for equipment instead of procurement points, or vice-versa.
2.   She can smooth over tensions with the ex-NATO countries when unfortunate cluste bomb incidents arise. 

**Wayne** *"waino the wino"* was an F-15C pilot until an unfortunate ejection incident left him unable to fly. His specialties are flight planning (1) and fighter escort training(2). His connections are a Skunkworks Engineer, an Elvis impersonator named "Rhinestone Louie", and an Exxon employed civilian drone surveyor. 
{.annotate}

1.   He will have insight into likely locations for OPFOR combat air patrols. The MC may use these paths unless the narrative drives it otherwise.
2.   A single flight of escorts may be one skill level higher during the mission.
