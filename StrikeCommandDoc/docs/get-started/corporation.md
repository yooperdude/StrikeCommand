# The Corporation :material-cash-100:

The Corporation is the entity by which you will procure assets, perform missions, and accept payment. The players will procure assets through the corporation, decide upon contracts, and finally plan missions for the corporation. The corporation is as much a member of the group as are the players, and even more so to some degree.

## Name

Name your corporation! Here are a few examples.

* Neutrality Assured PMC
* The Shrieking Deadbirds
* The Romantic Businessmen
* Pegasus Knights
* The Flying Circus

## Investors

Unless you are a group of independently wealthy trust fundies, then you likely have investors. In the economic meltdown money fled traditional investing and sought high returns wherever it could be found. An absolute glut of investor cash is available across the globe to anyone who is savvy enough to pitch it. Examples include insurance companies, banks, retirement funds, even Reddit listed stock bundles. Money flows to Bitcoin ETF's, into mercenary markets, and finds its way into the munitions on your aircraft.

Investors can act as your *"alignment"*. For example, a retirement fund for Teachers, would absolutely not take morally ambigious missions. While others, such as a Hedge Fund conglomerate wouldn't blink an eye if you cluster bombed an orphanage... for a profit. 

Think about how your investor(s) would think about an action. Here are some examples.

**Amalgamated Life and Trust of Central New York** Low risk tolerance with a flexible moral compass. Completely unwilling to see UN, US, or ex-NATO assets attacked.

**Western Nevada Teachers Retirement Fund** High risk tolerance with a rigid moral compass. Only able to take humanitarian mission or against absolutely evil regimes or mercenary groups. Low tolerance for friendly fire or civilian casualties.

**GS Investment - Cayman Islands** High Risk Tolerance with an absent moral compass. You may accept any mission, contracts, or situations that present a high profit.

**That Internet Site LLC** Medium risk tolerance with a flexible moral compass. You may accept any mission that furthers the goals of the upvote.

## Procurement Points

Procurement Points (PP) are how you purchase aircraft, facilities, weaponry, upgrades, botes, and anything else that you need.

The group has 10 PP's per player in the group plus whatever additional points they bring from their background (or rich Uncle). This number is so that a small group of players is not overwhelmed with aircraft to plan for while a large group will have plenty of options.

There will be more guidance in the [procurement](../procurement/process.md) section as to how this flows and recomendations. 

Err on the side of cool. If you want F-101 Starfighters, and nothing but, then by all means do it! Just pick missions that fit your niche. It's not your money, right?
