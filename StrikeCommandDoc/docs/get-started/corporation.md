# The Corporation :material-cash-100:

The Corporation is the entity by which you will procure assets, perform missions, and accept payment. The players will procure assets through the corporation, decide upon contracts, and finally plan missions for the corporation. The corporation is as much a member of the group as are the players, and even more so to some degree.

## Name

Name your corporation! Here are a few examples.

* Neutrality Assured PMC
* The Shrieking Deadbirds
* The Romantic Businessmen
* Pegasus Knights
* The Flying Circus

## Investors

Unless you are a group of independently wealthy trust fundies, then you likely have investors. In the economic meltdown money fled traditional investing and sought high returns wherever it could be found. An absolute glut of investor cash is available across the globe to anyone who is savvy enough to pitch it. Examples include insurance companies, banks, retirement funds, even Reddit listed stock bundles. Money flows to Bitcoin ETF's, into mercenary markets, and finds its way into the munitions on your aircraft.

Investors can act as your *"alignment"*. For example, a retirement fund for Teachers, would absolutely not take morally ambigious missions. While others, such as a Hedge Fund conglomerate wouldn't blink an eye if you cluster bombed an orphanage... for a profit. 

Think about how your investor(s) would think about an action. Here are some examples.

**Amalgamated Life and Trust of Central New York** Low risk tolerance with a flexible moral compass. Completely unwilling to see UN, US, or ex-NATO assets attacked.

**Western Nevada Teachers Retirement Fund** High risk tolerance with a rigid moral compass. Only able to take humanitarian mission or against absolutely evil regimes or mercenary groups. Low tolerance for friendly fire or civilian casualties.

**GS Investment - Cayman Islands** High Risk Tolerance with an absent moral compass. You may accept any mission, contracts, or situations that present a high profit.

**That Internet Site LLC** Medium risk tolerance with a flexible moral compass. You may accept any mission that furthers the goals of the upvote.

## Procurement Points

Procurement Points (PP) are how you purchase aircraft, facilities, weaponry, upgrades, botes, and anything else that you need.

**The group has 10 PP's per player in the group plus whatever additional points they bring from their background (or rich Uncle).** This number is so that a small group of players is not overwhelmed with aircraft to plan for while a large group will have plenty of options.

There will be more guidance in the [procurement](../procurement/process.md) section as to how this flows and recomendations. 

Your initial seed money is used up during this phase. All maintenance, acquistions, upgrades, and operations expenses come from earnings. Or from **Louie the Loan Shark** who may require some concessions on the next mission...

## Supplier

You will need to choose who provides your aircraft. The Supplier will be your partner in operations and specializes in a certain flavor of aircraft and equipment. They not only have the aircraft but the connections to keep it maintained, supplied, stocked with weaponry, upgraded, and most importantly replaced! 

Acquiring aircraft through a Supplier has one huge benefit, and that is [insurance](../procurement/insurance.md). More on that later, but it allows you to acquire replacements at no, or low, cost. While acquiring through the [black market](../procurement/black-market.md) comes with no such guarantee.

Err on the side of cool! Procurement will have more information on how to determine what is capable and what is not. If for some reason you pick a variant with less capability that is infinitely cool, then roll with it. Find your niche and dominate it.

The starting aircraft packages are all set up to allow you to be fairly functional and then expand. Each will come with fighters, attack aircraft, and some support options. Later on you can spend PP on things like stand off  

### Ivanov Brothers

The Ivanov Brothers bring the finest in Soviet, Russian, and associated nations. The aircraft they offer may lack the sophistication of Western jets, but make up for it with robust SAM systems and a quantity with a certain quality of its own. 

Example Fighter : [MIG-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21), [MIG-29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-29), [SU-27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-27)

Example Attack Aircraft : [SU-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-25), [SU-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-17), [MIG-27K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-27)

Example Support Units : [SA-11 "Gadfly"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system), [SA-22 "Greyhound"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantsir_missile_system), [ZSU-23-4 "Shilka"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZSU-23-4_Shilka)

### Broadstreet Ford, Lincoln, and Military

After the dissolution of NATO and beginning of US Isolation the US Air National Guard needed to liquidate to levels not seen since pre WW2. So patriot companies like Broadstreet Ford, Lincoln, and Military stepped up. They offer what is, without a doubt, the finest aircraft in the world. Just slightly abused by the Guard over the last 20 years of Operations Bomb Dirt, and Bomb Dirt 2, the redux.

Example Fighter : [F-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon), [F-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle), [F-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet)

Example Attack Aircraft : [F-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon), [F-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle), [A-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II)

Example Support Units : [UH-60 "Blackhawk"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk), [MIM-23 "Hawk"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-23_Hawk), [C-130 "Hercules"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules)

### Klaus and Pedersen

Europe, quick to follow suit in the budget crunch needed to have representation for industry in the emerging PMC market. So from that came a German-Swedish conglomerate. No one wanted to maintain NATO levels of military budgets but they were afraid that the industry would suffer. So what better way than get foreign investors to unwittingly fund this endeavor? Professional. Crisp. Bureaucratic.

Example Fighter : [JAS-39 Gripen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_JAS_39_Gripen), [Panavia Tornado IDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavia_Tornado), [Mirage 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_2000)

Example Attack Aircraft : [JAS-39 Gripen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_JAS_39_Gripen), [Harrier GR9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aerospace_Harrier_II), [Super Etendard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault-Breguet_Super_%C3%89tendard)

Example Support Units : [SAAB 340 AEW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_340), [Groundmaster Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_Master_400), [Crotale SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotale_(missile))

### Other

Later we will expand with other suppliers but this will cover the big three; Ex-Warsaw Pact, NATO/US, and EU. There is an absolute ton of aircraft available just from these three sources. There is also the [Black Market](../procurement/black-market.md) for oddball and one off aircraft.
