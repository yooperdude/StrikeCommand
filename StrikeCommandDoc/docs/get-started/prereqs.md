# Prerequisites

## The Mercenary Coordinator

One player must volunteer to run the game as the Mercenary Coordinator (MC), and be the DM for the game. This person does not neccessarily need to be the most knowledgable of military hardware but have a feel for narrative and be comfortable making the missions (more on this later). This person will create orders for the OPFOR and help develop the narrative in the theater.

The MC will help the players make characters, a corporation, and navigate the procurement phase. After this the MC becomes the storyteller, mission maker, and intel source for the operations to come.

## Software

One person, preferably the MC, will need to own [Command : Modern Operations](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076160/Command_Modern_Operations/). If you are playing remotely you should become familiar with software such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and stream the game through a platform like Twitch or YouTube. Platforms like Zoom are also an option.

The players do not need to own CMO, though it may be helpful for research purposes. The players will make a mission profile verbally, with maps, text, or a combination of them all.

Note, CMO periodically goes on sale for 50% off.

## Reference

There is a great deal of knowledge to be acquired in order to be effective. You can research at Wikipedia, the [CMANO-DB](https://cmano-db.com/), or US Military Databases such as [ODIN](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/). Understanding your threats and assets is essential for both the player and the MC. 

## Dice

The MC and Players may use physical dice or they can use an [online random number generator](https://www.random.org/).

## Platforms

You can play in person or streaming through a site like [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) or [YouTube](https://youtube.com). Other options include online forums or a site like Reddit. Later on we'll walk through specific examples on how to leverage online platforms with periodic intel drops.
